# Installation

3. Activate the theme

For the default Rose Pine and Rose Pine Moon, please switch to the dark theme on twitter. 

The accent colour can be adjusted via the theme adjuster on twitter as well.

# Notes
The accent colours for some text is hardcoded onto twitter without selectors. There is not much I can do about this unfortunately.
