# Rosé Pine Twitter

A Stylus theme for Twitter, using the [Rosé Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) palette.

## Screenshots

## Installation

1. Install Stylus
2. Open this link
3. Activate the theme

For the default **Rosé Pine** and **Rosé Pine Moon**, please switch to the dark theme on twitter.

The accent colour can be adjusted via the theme adjuster on twitter as well.

## Notes

- The accent colours for some text is hardcoded onto twitter without selectors. There is not much I can do about this unfortunately.
- `main.user.css` is written in [UserCSS](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Writing-UserCSS#var) for customization
  - The base is written in SCSS for convenience, `main.user.css` is written off of the compiled SCSS
